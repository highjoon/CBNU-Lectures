Python 3.x is a new version of the language, which is incompatible with
the 2.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details,
especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been
removed.
Build Instructions
------------------
On Unix, Linux, BSD, OSX, and Cygwin:
